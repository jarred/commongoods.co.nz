# Phil Cuttance

The first time I met Phil he greeted me with a two handed gesture that required me to do the same and slot our hands together (something most young boys have done to learn what the female genitals look like..). 
How can you not become friends with a guy like that. He earned the nickname 'Fingers' and we went on to exhibit together, along with <a href="http://www.goldsworthystudio.com/" target="_blank">Nathan Goldsworthy</a> at the Milan Salone Satellite in 2009.
One of the most original, funny, sincere and mental people I have ever met - in a tough design market, I closed down Punga & Smith to start COMMON - Phil moved to London, focussed his work around process based concepts and thrived. 

Constantly innovating, winning awards and getting press, Phil is the kind of person you meet once and never forget.
