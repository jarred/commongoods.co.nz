# Houghton Bay House 

Design of a 2 bedroom, 115sqm home on a steep triangular South facing site in Houghton Bay, Wellington, NZ.
The large picture window allows the house to turn its back on the notorious South coast elements while also allowing a view of the bush and ocean. 
The uphill North aspect resulted in the house being set in the hill with the majority of the windows looking on to the North facing courtyard, a safe place for the couples two small children to play.
