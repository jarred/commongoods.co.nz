# Ben Pearce

Ben and I first met about 5 years ago when he helped me out with a gallery show in Christchurch. At the time his pieces were based around sound amplification due to a childhood speech impediment. Now, due to his body reacting to the chemicals in the paints he was using, he works mainly in wood. Ben's work is beautifully honest and so intrinsically related to who he is. Sit down for a cup of tea with Ben and you can't help walking away a little light headed - his delicate, thoughtful view of the world is almost childlike, and utterly inspiring.  <a href="http://www.benpearce.co.nz/" target="_blank">(BENPEARCE.CO.NZ)</a>
