# Punga & Smith

Before COMMON I was Punga & Smith, a furniture company set up while at University and run for around seven years. Punga & Smith was available at furniture stores around New Zealand, exhibited at the Milan furniture fair in 2009, published on blogs, in magazines and books, and collaborated on projects with the likes of 42below and Bombay Sapphire. 

Punga & Smith closed down in 2010 to make room for COMMON, a more multidisciplinary approach.
