# Uncle Stan

Uncle Stan and his brother Bob had a foundry in Christchurch back in the day. One day my Grandad, Fred, bought a brand new table saw and set it up in his garage, the next day it was gone. Returned a week later, his brothers Stan and Bob had taken it, stripped it down, made sand moulds and cast themselves two copies using the steel from old car pistons, with the addition of repurposed motors and new blades the table saw became three. Uncle Stan later lost his three middle fingers to the table saw.
