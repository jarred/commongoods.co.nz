# COMMON 2 Colour Palette

I came across these works by Sherrie Levine at MOMA, New York. Her piece *After Kirchner, 1989* will serve as the colour palette for COMMON #2.

*This print is part of a series of woodcuts derived from canonical paintings by four
early modernists: Marcel Duchamp, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Piet Mondrian, and 
Claude Monet. To make the prints, the artist photographed a reproduction of each work, 
scanned the photos, and reduced each digital file to twelve pixels using a computer 
program. These simplified images were used as the source material for the woodcuts, 
eliminating any detail, brushwork, or distinguishing formal traits among the masterworks, 
transforming them into abstract variations. Since her emergence in the early 1980s, 
Levine has been deeply invested in questions of artistic originality, pioneering 
appropriation art by making copies of works by well-known twentieth-century male 
artists and claiming them as her own work. Her groundbreaking approach has been 
enormously influential, as many artists in todayâ€™s Internet-saturated culture have 
inherited this fluid relationship with images and her skepticism toward the concept 
of uniqueness.*
